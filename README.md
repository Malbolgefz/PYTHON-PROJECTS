# PYTHON-PROJECTS
OpenCv project

Motion detection usiing python and opencv.
This code is mainly used to detect movement.Face detection can also be implement in this code using haar cascade classifier.

I am planning to modify the code to make it do some useful thing ,like mask detection i.e. whether a person is wearing mask or not.
